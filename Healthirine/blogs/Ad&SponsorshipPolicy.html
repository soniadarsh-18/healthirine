                    providing trustworthy health information very seriously. Before accepting any advertisement or
                    sponsorship, we review the content thoroughly to ensure that it is appropriate for our audience and
                    aligns with our mission. Our team of experts assesses the accuracy and reliability of the
                    information provided in the ad or sponsorship to ensure that it meets our high standards. We reserve
                    the right to reject any ad or sponsorship that we feel is not in the best interest of our readers.

                    and sponsorships from third-party companies, we do not endorse or promote any specific products or
                    services. Our commitment to our readers is to provide unbiased and accurate health information. We
                    believe that it is essential to remain impartial and not favor any specific product or service. Our
                    readers' trust is of utmost importance to us, and we strive to provide them with the best possible

                    harmful to our readers. For this reason, we do not accept ads that promote tobacco or e-cigarette
                    products, adult content, or any content that could be misleading or fraudulent. We believe that this
                    policy helps us to maintain our commitment to providing accurate and trustworthy health information.

                    “advertisement” or “sponsored content.” We also make sure that these ads are visually distinct from
                    our editorial content so that our readers can easily distinguish between the two. This ensures that
